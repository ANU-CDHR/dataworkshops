The Data Workshop repository can be used as a resource for teaching and learning data collection, cleaning, and visualisation techniques. These notebooks showcase the processes of data gathering and visualisation including data gathering for social media platforms, wikipedia, webpage, news sources and so on through APIs, download and webscraping; data cleaning and preparation; data analysis and visualisation from the acquired data. The notebooks utilise Twitter API (https://docs.tweepy.org/), Python modules (https://pypi.org/) including tweepy, wikipedia, google_play, panda, plotly, matplotlib. Please check references in notebooks for more details.
